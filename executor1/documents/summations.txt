<span class="highlighting" >Amyloid</span> is a term used to describe deposits of fibrillar proteins, typically extracellular. The abnormal accumulation of <span class="highlighting" >amyloid</span>, amyloidosis, is a term associated with tissue damage caused by <span class="highlighting" >amyloid</span> deposition, seen in numerous diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's. <span class="highlighting" >Amyloid</span> deposits consist predominantly of <span class="highlighting" >amyloid</span> fibrils, rigid, non-branching structures that form ordered assemblies, characteristically with a cross <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-sheet structure where the sheets run parallel to the direction of the fibril (Sawaya et al. 2007). Often the fibril has a left-handed twist (Nelson & Eisenberg 2006). At least 27 human proteins form <span class="highlighting" >amyloid</span> fibrils (Sipe et al. 2010). Many of these proteins have non-pathological functions; the trigger that leads to abnormal aggregations differs between proteins and is not well understood but in many cases the peptides are abnormal fragments or mutant forms arising from polymorphisms, suggesting that the initial event may be aggregation of misfolded or unfolded peptides. Early studies of <span class="highlighting" >Amyloid</span>-<span class="highlighting" >beta</span> assembly led to a widely accepted model that assembly was a nucleation-dependent polymerization reaction (Teplow 1998) but it is now understood to be more complex, with multiple 'off-pathway' events leading to a variety of oligomeric structures in addition to fibrils (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), though it is unclear whether these intermediate steps are required in vivo. An increasing body of evidence suggests that these oligomeric forms are primarily responsible for the neurotoxic effects of <span class="highlighting" >Amyloid</span>-<span class="highlighting" >beta</span> (Roychaudhuri et al. 2008), alpha-synuclein (Winner et al. 2011) and tau (Dance & Strobel 2009, Meraz-Rios et al. 2010). <span class="highlighting" >Amyloid</span> oligomers are believed to have a common structural motif that is independent of the protein involved and not present in fibrils (Kayed et al. 2003). Conformation dependent, aggregation specific antibodies suggest that there are 3 general classes of <span class="highlighting" >amyloid</span> oligomer structures (Glabe 2009) including annular structures which may be responsible for the widely reported membrane permeabilization effect of <span class="highlighting" >amyloid</span> oligomers. Toxicity of <span class="highlighting" >amyloid</span> oligomers preceeds the appearance of plaques in mouse models (Ferretti et al. 2011). <br>Fibrils are often associated with other molecules, notably heparan sulfate proteoglycans and Serum <span class="highlighting" >Amyloid</span> P-component, which are universally associated and seem to stabilize fibrils, possibly by protecting them from degradation.
FP-1039 is a soluble fusion protein consisting of the extracellular region of FGFR1c bound to the Fc region of human IgG1.  It is capable of binding to a wide range of FGF ligands and thereby prevents activation of multiple FGF receptors.  FP-1039 is in Phase I clinical trials in solid malignancies and in Phase II trials for patients with endometrial cancers harbouring the activating mutations S252W and P253R (reviewed in Wesche, 2011).
Gene amplification of the ERBB2 (HER2) oncogene is observed across various different <span class="highlighting" >cancer</span> types. In addition to HER2 gene amplification, sequencing of tumour samples have revealed HER2 mutations, which fall within three major regions:  the extracellular domain (ECD), transmembrane domain/ juxtamembrane domain (TMD/JMD) and kinase domain (KD). Based on the functional studies of their catalytic activity, signaling and drug sensitivity, as well as their time of occurence with respect to treatment, these mutation can be classified as primary mutations, that can be activating or silent, and may confer drug resistance, and secondary mutations, associated with development of drug resistance upon initial response to targeted therapy.<br><br>Overexpression of ERBB2 (HER2) protein, usually as a consequence of ERBB2 gene amplification, leads to formation of constitutively active, growth factor independent, ERBB2 homodimers, which are sensitive to the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab (herceptin) (Pickl and Ries 2009).<br>Co-overexpression of ERBB2 and its dimerization partner ERBB3 leads to formation of both ERBB2 homodimers and ERRB2:ERBB3 heterodimers and is associated with chemotherapy resistance and reduced relapse-free and overall survival (Spears et al. 2012).<br><br>Mutations in the kinase domain (KD) of ERBB2 result in constitutive activation of ERBB2 signaling, facilitate heterodimerization of ERBB2 with other EGFR family members and increase the signaling intensity (Kancha et al. 2011). Functionally studied ERBB2 KD mutants include ERBB2 L755S, ERBB2 L755P, ERBB2 I767M, ERBB2 D769H, ERBB2 V777L, ERBB2 P780_Y781insGSP, ERBB2 T798I, ERBB2 T798M, ERBB2 V842I, ERBB2 T862A, ERBB2 L869R, ERBB2 H878Y and ERBB2 R896C (Kancha et al. 2011, Bose et al. 2013, Collier et al. 2013, Hu, Wan et al. 2015; Hu, Hu et al. 2015, Hanker et al. 2017, Croessmann et al. 2019).<br><br>Sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab (herceptin) differs between different ERBB2 KD mutants (Bose et al. 2013, Rexer et al. 2013, Nagano et al. 2018).<br><br>ERBB2 extracellular domain (ECD) mutants harbor missense mutations that lead to substitutions of amino acid residues in the heterodimerization arm contact surface, involved in formation of ERBB2 heterodimers (Greulich et al. 2012).<br><br>Recurrent missense mutations in regions encoding the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the juxtamembrane domain (JMD) are frequently reported in <span class="highlighting" >cancer</span>. TMD and JMD mutations can activate ERBB2 signaling by improving the active dimer interface or by stabilizing the active conformation (Ou et al. 2017, Pahuja et al. 2018).<br><br>ERBB2 TMD/JMD mutants differ in their sensitivity to the therapeutic antibody pertuzumab, which blocks ligand-driven heterodimerization of ERBB2 (Pahuja et al. 2018).
CDK5, activated by binding to p25, phosphorylates CDC25A protein tyrosine phosphatase at serine residues S40, S116 and S261. CDC25A mainly localizes to the nucleus in neurons and CDK5-mediated phosphorylation does not change its localization. Once activated by CDK5, CDC25A promotes activation of CDK1, CDK2 and CDK4 (Chang et al. 2012).
Post-mitotic neurons do not have an active cell cycle. However, deregulation of Cyclin Dependent Kinase-5 (CDK5) activity in these neurons can aberrantly activate various components of cell cycle leading to neuronal death (Chang et al. 2012). Random activation of cell cycle proteins has been shown to play a key role in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders (Yang et al. 2003, Lopes et al. 2009). CDK5 is not activated by the canonical cyclins, but binds to its own specific partners, CDK5R1 and CDK5R2 (aka p35 and p39, respectively) (Tsai et al. 1994, Tang et al. 1995). Expression of p35 is nearly ubiquitous, whereas p39 is largely expressed in the central nervous system. A variety of neurotoxic insults such as beta-amyloid (A-beta), ischemia, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress disrupt the intracellular calcium homeostasis in neurons, thereby leading to the activation of calpain, which cleaves p35 into p25 and p10 (Lee et al. 2000). p25 has a six-fold longer half-life compared to p35 and lacks the membrane anchoring signal, which results in its constitutive activation and mislocalization of the CDK5:p25 complex to the cytoplasm and the nucleus. There, CDK5:p25 is able to access and phosphorylate a variety of atypical targets, triggering a cascade of neurotoxic pathways that culminate in neuronal death. One such neurotoxic pathway involves CDK5-mediated random activation of cell cycle proteins which culminate in neuronal death. Exposure of primary cortical neurons to oligomeric beta-amyloid (1-42) hyper-activates CDK5 due to p25 formation, which in turn phosphorylates CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C. CDK5 phosphorylates CDC25A at S40, S116 and S261; CDC25B at S50, T69, S160, S321 and S470; and CDC25C at T48, T67, S122, T130, S168 and S214. CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C not only increases their phosphatase activities but also facilitates their release from 14-3-3 inhibitory binding. CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C in turn activate CDK1, CDK2 and CDK4 kinases causing neuronal death. Consistent with this mechanism, higher CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C activities were observed in human Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical samples, as compared to age-matched controls. Inhibition of CDC25 isoforms confers neuroprotection to beta-amyloid toxicity, which underscores the contribution of this pathway to AD pathogenesis
The human gene SLC22A18 (aka TSSC5) encodes organic cation transporter-like protein 2 (ORCTL2). It is expressed at high levels in kidney, liver and colon and at lower levels in heart, brain and <span class="highlighting" >lung</span>. ORCTL2 can transport organic cations such as chloroquine and quinidine with the antiport of protons.<br><br>The human chromosome region 11p15.5 is linked with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (associated with susceptibility to Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma and hepatoblastoma). SLC22A18 is located in this region (Cooper et al. 1998, Lee et al. 1998). Mutations and/or reduced expression of SLC22A18 have been found in certain tumors such as <span class="highlighting" >lung</span> <span class="highlighting" >cancer</span> (LNCR; MIM:211980) (Lee et al. 1998) and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma 1 (RMSE1; MIM:268210) (Schwienbacher et al. 1998). How SLC22A18 might be involved in growth regulation is poorly understood. There is speculation that it may be involved in resistance to chemotherapy drugs and/or in the export of genotoxic substances whose retention may increase the risk of tumor formation.
EGFRvIII mutant lacks the ligand binding domain and is therefore unable to bind EGFR ligands (Fernandes et al. 2001). 
<span class="highlighting" >Apoptosis</span> is a distinct form of cell death that is functionally and morphologically different from necrosis. Nuclear chromatin condensation, cytoplasmic shrinking, dilated endoplasmic reticulum, and membrane blebbing characterize <span class="highlighting" >apoptosis</span> in general. Mitochondria remain morphologically unchanged. In 1972 Kerr et al introduced the concept of <span class="highlighting" >apoptosis</span> as a distinct form of "cell-death", and the mechanisms of various apoptotic pathways are still being revealed today. <BR>The two principal  pathways of <span class="highlighting" >apoptosis</span> are (1) the Bcl-2 inhibitable or intrinsic pathway induced by various forms of stress like intracellular damage, developmental cues, and external stimuli and (2) the caspase 8/10 dependent or extrinsic pathway initiated by the engagement of death receptors<BR> The caspase 8/10 dependent or extrinsic pathway is a death receptor mediated mechanism that results in the activation of caspase-8 and caspase-10. Activation of death receptors like Fas/CD95, TNFR1, and the TRAIL receptor is promoted by the TNF family of ligands including FASL (APO1L OR CD95L), TNF, LT-alpha, LT-beta, CD40L, LIGHT, RANKL, BLYS/BAFF, and APO2L/TRAIL. These ligands are released  in response to microbial infection, or as part of the cellular, humoral immunity responses during the formation of lymphoid organs, activation of dendritic cells, stimulation or survival of T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells, cytotoxic response to viral infection or oncogenic transformation. <BR> The Bcl-2 inhibitable or intrinsic pathway of <span class="highlighting" >apoptosis</span> is a stress-inducible process, and acts through the activation of caspase-9 via Apaf-1 and cytochrome c. The rupture of the mitochondrial membrane, a rapid process involving some of the Bcl-2 family proteins, releases these molecules into the cytoplasm. Examples of cellular processes that may induce the intrinsic pathway in response to various damage signals include: auto reactivity in lymphocytes, cytokine deprivation, calcium flux or cellular damage by cytotoxic drugs like taxol, deprivation of nutrients like glucose and growth factors like EGF, anoikis, transactivation of target genes by tumor suppressors including p53.<BR> In many non-immune cells, death signals initiated by the extrinsic pathway are amplified by connections to the intrinsic pathway. The connecting link appears to be the truncated BID (tBID) protein a proteolytic cleavage product mediated by caspase-8 or other enzymes.
Beta amyloid increases influx of extracellular calcium (Ca2+) through the plasma membrane, thus increasing the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. The mechanism has not been completely elucidated (Lee et al. 2000, Abramov et al. 2004).
Diseases of mitotic cell cycle are caused by mutations in cell cycle regulators (Collins and Garrett 2005, Diaz-Moralli et al. 2013), such as retinoblastoma protein RB1 (Classon and Harlow 2002), as well as proteins involved in telomere maintenance, such as ATRX and DAXX (Sarek et al. 2015). These diseases mainly include different types of cancer, hereditary syndromes such as dyskeratosis congenita that may predispose affected patients to cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases (Webber et al. 2005).
Several agrin (AGRN) ligands require the presence of heparan-sulfate GAG sidechains and probably represent interactions with them. Extracellular ligands include <span class="highlighting" >Beta</span>-<span class="highlighting" >amyloid</span> (Donahue et al. 1999, Cotman et al. 2000). Other ligands (unconfirmed in humans) include alpha-synuclein fibrils (chicken - Liu et al. 2005), HB-GAM/pleiotropin (Dagget et al. 1996), thrombospondin and FGF2 (Cotman et al. 1999).
A variety of neurotoxic insults such as beta-amyloid (A-beta), ischemia, excitotoxicity and oxidative stress disrupt the intracellular calcium homeostasis in neurons, thereby leading to the activation of calpain, which cleaves p35 into p25 and p10 (Lee et al. 2000). p25 has a six-fold longer half-life compared to p35 and lacks the membrane anchoring signal, which results in its constitutive activation and mislocalization of the CDK5:p25 complex to the cytoplasm and the nucleus.<p>Calpain-mediated cleavage of p35 to p25 is inhibited by calpastatin (CAST). CAST levels are decreased in <span class="highlighting" >Alzheimer</span> disease (Sato et al. 2011). 
OGG1 is the main DNA glycosylase responsible for removal of 8-oxoguanine (8oxoG), the most frequent type of oxidative DNA damage, from DNA and initiation of the base excision repair (Klungland et al. 1999, Minowa et al. 2000). A frequent OGG1 polymorphism increases the risk of breast and lung cancer in affected individuals, and inactivating mutations in OGG1 have been reported in various cancer types and in Alzheimer's disease. Ogg1 knockout mice are predisposed to cancer. For review, please refer to Boiteux et al. 2017. 
NADE forms a complex with the 14-3-3epsilon isoform. The last one interacts with caspase 3 through its C terminal region. The NADE:4-3-3epsilon complex negatively regulates p75NTR-mediated <span class="highlighting" >apoptosis</span>, probably by down regulating caspase activity.
The WNT signaling pathway has been linked with <span class="highlighting" >cancer</span> ever since the identification of the first WNT as a gene activated by integration of mouse mammary tumor virus proviral DNA in virally-induced breast tumors (Nusse et al, 1984).  The most well known example of aberrant WNT signaling in <span class="highlighting" >cancer</span> is in colorectal <span class="highlighting" >cancer</span>, where an activating mutation in a WNT pathway component is seen in 90% of sporadic cases.  Inappropriate WNT pathway activation has also been implicated in most other solid human cancers but is not always associated with mutations in WNT pathway components (reviewed in Polakis, 2012).<br>Both tumor suppressors and oncogenes have been identified in the so-called canonical WNT pathway, which regulates WNT-dependent transcription by promoting the degradation of beta-catenin in the absence of ligand (reviewed in Polakis, 2012).  Loss-of-function mutations in the destruction complex components APC, Axin and AMER1 and gain-of-function mutations in beta-catenin itself cause constitutive signaling and are found in cancers of the intestine, kidney, liver and stomach, among others (Polakis, 1995; Segiditsas and Tomlinson, 2006; Peifer and Polakis, 2000; Laurent-Puig et al, 2001; Liu et al, 2000; Satoh et al, 2000; Major et al, 2007; Ruteshouser et al, 2008). WNTs and WNT pathway components are also frequently over- or under-expressed in various cancers, and these changes are correlated with epigenetic regulation of promoter activity.  In some contexts, both the canonical and non-canonical WNT signaling, which governs processes such as cell polarity and morphogenesis, may also contribute to tumor formation by promoting cell migration, invasiveness and metastasis.
One of the functions of PTEN is to act as a phosphoinositide phosphatase that catalyzes dephosphorylation of PIP3 into PIP2. PTEN thus reduces the amount of available PIP3, counteracting PI3K activity and downregulating AKT signaling. PTEN is frequently targeted by loss of function mutations in <span class="highlighting" >cancer</span> and in familial <span class="highlighting" >cancer</span> syndromes known as PTHS (PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes, a collection of diseases including Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, and Lhermitte-Duclos disease). Some PTEN loss-of-function variants are also found in autism spectrum disorder patients. For a recent review of PTEN involvement in <span class="highlighting" >cancer</span>, please refer to Hollander et al. 2011. <br> <br>The majority of missense mutations that impair phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of PTEN cluster in exon 5 of PTEN gene and result in substitution of amino acid residues in the catalytic cleft of the phosphatase domain. Arginine at position 130 is the most frequently substituted PTEN residue in <span class="highlighting" >cancer</span>. R130 of human PTEN is the last arginine residue in the conserved H-C-K/R-A-G-K-G-R sequence (corresponding to HCXXGXXR motif of protein tyrosine phosphatases) in the catalytic cleft of the PTEN phosphatase domain and is essential for catalysis (Barford et al. 1994, Lee et al. 1999). PTEN R130 substitution mutants show markedly decreased phosphoinositide phosphatase activity (Han et al. 2000, Koul et al. 2002) and are frequently found in endometrial carcinoma (Kong et al. 1997, Konopka et al. 2007). The cysteine residue at position 124 (C124) of human PTEN, in the conserved H-C-K/R-A-G-K-G-R sequence, 'attacks' the phosphate group of a substrate and forms a thio-phosphate intermediate during the dephosphorylation reaction (Guan and Dixon 1991, Barford et al. 1994, Lee et al. 1999). Therefore, substitution of this critical C124 abolishes PTEN phosphatase activity (Han et al. 2000, Koul et al. 2002). Substitution of histidine H123 in the conserved H-C-K/R-A-G-K-G-R sequence also impairs PTEN phosphatase activity (Lee et al. 1999).<br><br>Missense mutations also target amino acid residues in the N-terminal phosphatase domain that are outside the catalytic cleft. Substitution of histidine at position 93 affects the conserved WPD loop of the phosphatase domain of PTEN, and PTEN H93 mutants show low phosphoinositide phosphatase activity (Lee et al. 1999). Serine residue S170 and histidine residue H173 participate in the formation of hydrogen bonds between the N-terminal phosphatase domain of PTEN and the C-terminal membrane-binding C2 domain (Lee et al. 1999). H173, and to a lesser extent S170, are targeted by missense mutations in <span class="highlighting" >cancer</span>, and substitution mutants have impaired phosphoinositide phosphatase activity (Han et al. 2000). <br><br>Missense mutations also occur in the C2 domain of PTEN. The C2 domain is implicated in membrane binding and localization of PTEN, but also in PTEN roles unrelated to its phosphoinositide phosphatase function (Raftopoulou et al. 2004). Since the roles of these C2 domain PTEN mutants in <span class="highlighting" >cancer</span> have not been clarified, these variants will be annotated when more information becomes available. <br><br>Besides missense mutations, nonsense mutations that result in PTEN protein truncation are also frequently found in <span class="highlighting" >cancer</span> samples. The three residues most frequently targeted by nonsense mutations are R130, R233 and R335. While R130* mutation directly affects the phosphatase domain of PTEN, R233* and R335* affect the C2 domain. PTEN 130*, PTEN R233* and PTEN R335* mutants have not been functionally studied, but it was shown that comparable PTEN truncation mutants generated by directed mutagenesis, PTEN-254 and PTEN-342, were unstable when expressed in human cells and had severely diminished phosphatase activity in vitro (Georgescu et al. 1999). <br><span class="highlighting" >Cancer</span>-derived PTEN truncation mutants whose phosphatase domain (amino acid residues 14-185) is absent or partially truncated are annotated as truncation mutant set members (PTEN E7*, PTEN R11*, PTEN K13*, PTEN Q17*, PTEN E18*, PTEN G20*, PTEN L23*, PTEN Y27*, PTEN E40*, PTEN E43*, PTEN Y46*, PTEN S59*, PTEN K62*, PTEN Y65*, PTEN Y68*, PTEN E73*, PTEN R84*, PTEN Y88*, PTEN E91*, PTEN Q97*, PTEN E99*, PTEN C105*, PTEN Q110*, PTEN W111*, PTEN E114*, PTEN K125*, PTEN G127*, PTEN K128*, PTEN G129*, PTEN R130*, PTEN Y138*, PTEN L139*, PTEN L146*, PTEN K147*, PTEN Q149*, PTEN E150*, PTEN E157*, PTEN K163*, PTEN G165*, PTEN Q171*, PTEN Y174*, PTEN Y176*, PTEN Y177*, PTEN Y178*, PTEN Y180*, PTEN L182*).<br><span class="highlighting" >Cancer</span>-derived PTEN truncation mutants whose phosphatase domain is intact but whose C2 tensin-type domain (amino acids 190-350), responsible for interaction with membrane phospholipids and for the overall protein conformation (Lee et al. 1999), is missing or partially truncated are annotated as truncation mutant set candidates (PTEN R189*, PTEN G209*, PTEN C211*, PTEN Q214*, PTEN C218*, PTEN Q219*, PTEN K221*, PTEN Y225*, PTEN S229*, PTEN G230*, PTEN R233*, PTEN E235*, PTEN Y240*, PTEN E242*, PTEN Q245*, PTEN L247*, PTEN C250*, PTEN E256*, PTEN Q261*, PTEN K263*, PTEN W274*, PTEN E284*, PTEN S287*, PTEN E288*, PTEN E291*, PTEN G293*, PTEN C296*, PTEN Q298*, PTEN E299*, PTEN E307*, PTEN E314*, PTEN L320*, PTEN K330*, PTEN K332*, PTEN R335*, PTEN Y336*, PTEN K344*, PTEN Y346*).<br><br>In <span class="highlighting" >cancer</span>, PTEN is also frequently inactivated by genomic deletions and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) affecting chromosome band 10q23 or by epigenetic silencing (reviewed by Hollander et al. 2011).
COL25A1 is a brain-specific membrane-bound collagen. Proteolytic processing releases CLAC (collagenous <span class="highlighting" >Alzheimer</span> amyloid plaque component), a soluble form of COL25A1 containing the extracellular collagen domains. CLAC associates with amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, inhibiting amyloid fibril formation (Osada et al. 2005).
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) was first identified in the context of an oncogenic fusion with nucleophosmin (NPM) in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) (Morris et al, 1994). NPM-ALK fusions occur in approximately 75-80% of ALCL cases and at lower frequencies in other cancers, including non-small cell <span class="highlighting" >lung</span> <span class="highlighting" >cancer</span>, neuroblastoma and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IFTs) (Morris et al, 1994; Shiota et al, 1994; reviewed in Della Corte et al, 2018; Werner et al, 2017). <br><br>In addition to NPM, fusions of ALK with nearly 30 other 5' partners have since been identified, although these tend to occur at lower frequencies in the cancers in which they appear (reviewed in Chiarle et al, 2008; Della Corte et al, 2018; Roskoski, 2013; Hallberg and Palmer, 2016). In general, ALK fusions combine the 5' end of the partner gene which contributes a dimerization domain with the intracellular portion of the ALK receptor including the kinase domain, and lead to constitutive signaling by virtue of the partner-domain mediated dimerization (reviewed in Roskoski, 2013; Della Corte et al, 2018). <br><br>In addition to translocation events that lead to fusion proteins, the ALK gene also contributes to oncogenesis as a result of gene amplification and overexpression events, as well as being subject to activating missense mutations (reviewed in Della Corte et al, 2018; Hallberg and Palmer, 2016).  <br><br>Oncogenic ALK activity can be targeted with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, although resistance often arises due to secondary mutations or activation of bypass pathways (reviewed in Roskoski, 2013; Della Corte et al, 2018; Hallberg and Palmer, 2016; Werner et al, 2017; Lovly and Pao, 2012).
Humans have 38 <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-defensin genes plus 9-10 pseudogenes (details available on the HGNC website at http://www.genenames.org/genefamilies/DEFB). Many <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-defensins are encoded by recently duplicated genes giving rise to identical transcripts. Nomenclature is confusing and currently in transition. Uniprot recommended names are used throughout this pathway.<br>Many <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-defensins show expression that correlates with infection (Sahl et al. 2005, Pazgier et al. 2006). All so far characterized <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-defensins, i.e. <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-defensin 1 (hBD1), 4A (hBD2), 103 (hBD3), 104 (hBD4), 106 (hBD6), 118 (hBD18) and 128 (hBD28) have antimicrobial properties (Pazgier et al. 2006). For <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-defensins 4A, 103 and 118 (hBD2, 3, and 18) this has been shown to correlate with membrane permeabilization effects (Antcheva et al. 2004, Sahl et al. 2005, Yenugu et al. 2004). Electrostatic interaction and disruption of microbial membranes is widely believed to the primary mechanism of action for <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-defensins. Two models explain how membrane disruption takes place, the 'pore model' which postulates that <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-defensins form transmembrane pores in a similar manner to alpha-defensins, and the 'carpet model', which suggests that <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-defensins act as detergents. <span class="highlighting" >Beta</span>-defensins contain 6 conserved cysteine residues that in <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-defensins 1, 4A and 103 (hBD1-3) are experimentally confirmed to be cross-linked 1-5, 2-4, 3-6. The canonical sequence for <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-defensins is x2-10Cx5-6(G/A)xCX3-4Cx9-13Cx4-7CCxn. Structurally they are similar to alpha-defensins but with much shorter pre-regions. Though dimerization of some <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-defensins has been reported this is not the case for all and it is unclear whether it is required for function. The majority of functional studies have focused on <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-defensin 103 (hBD3), which has the most significant antimicrobial activity at physiological salt concentrations (Harder et al. 2001). <span class="highlighting" >Beta</span>-defensin 103  is highly cationic with a net charge of +11 e0.  It exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria and some gram-negative bacteria (Harder et al. 2001), though some species are highly resistant (Sahly et al. 2003). Sensitivity correlates with lipid composition of the membrane, with more negatively-charged lipids correlating with larger <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-defensin 103-induced changes in membrane capacitance (Bohling et al. 2006). Though membrane disruption is widely believed to be the primary mechanism of action of <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-defensins they have other antimicrobial properties, such as inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis (Sass et al. 2010), and chemoattractant effects (Yang et al. 1999, Niyonsaba et al. 2002, 2004). The chemotactic activity of <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-defensins 1, 4A and 103 (hBD1-3) for memory T cells and immature DCs is mediated through binding to the chemokine receptor CCR6 and probably another unidentified Gi-coupled receptor (Yang et al. 1999, 2000). <br> <br>Like defensins, the human cathelicidin LL37 peptide is rich in positively-charged  residues (Lehrer & Ganz 2002).<br>Expression of certain <span class="highlighting" >beta</span>-defensins can be induced in response to various signals, such as bacteria, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), or proinflammatory cytokines (Ganz 2003, Yang et al. 2004). Like the alpha-defensins, copy number variation has been reported for DEFB4, DEFB103 and DEFB104 with individuals having 2-12 copies per diploid genome. In contrast DEFB1 does not show such variation but exhibits a number of SNPs (Hollox et al. 2003, Linzmier & Ganz 2005).
Non-covalent (reversible) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib and vandetanib, selectively inhibit EGFR-stimulated tumor cell growth by blocking EGFR mutant autophosphorylation through competitive inhibition of ATP binding to the kinase domain. A number of EGFR kinase domain mutants and extracellular domain point mutants show increased senistivity to non-covalent TKIs compared with the wild-type EGFR. EGFR kinase domain mutants may be resistant to non-covalent TKIs due to primary or secondary mutations in the kinase domain that increase the affinity of the kinase domain for ATP, such as small insertions within exon 20, and substituion of threonine 790 with methionine (T790M).
Identified as a component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's brain, the ectodomain of type XXV collagen (known as CLAC) is released by furin convertase activity (Hashimoto et al. 2002). The presence of CLAC leads to Abeta fibril bundles that have an increased resistance to proteases (Söderberg et al. 2005).
The majority of OGG1 mutants have been tested for their ability to excise 8-oxoguanine (8oxoG) from damaged DNA, while a small number of mutants have been tested for the ability to remove FapyG from DNA.<br>The following OGG1 mutants show at least a partial loss of their ability to remove 8oxoG:<br>OGG1 R46Q (Audebert, Chevillard et al. 2000; Audebert, Radicella et al. 2000);<br>OGG1 R154H (Audebert, Radicella et al. 2000, Bruner et al. 2000);<br>OGG1 R131Q (Chevillard et al. 1998, Bruner et al. 2000, Anderson and Dagget 2009);<br>OGG1 R229Q (Hyun et al. 2000, Hyun et al. 2002, Hill and Evans 2007);<br>OGG1 P266fs139* (Mao et al. 2007).<br>OGG1 R46L and OGG1 R131G have not been functionally studied but have been reported in cancer and predicted to be pathogenic. They are annotated as candidate disease variants based on their similarity with OGG1 R46Q and OGG1 R131Q, respectively.<br>OGG1 S326C, a frequent variant in European and Asian populations, is susceptible to oxidation, which diminishes catalytic activity under conditions of oxidative stress (Dherin et al. 1999, Yamane et al. 2004, Kershaw and Hodges 2012, Moritz et al. 2014).<br>The following OGG1 mutants show at least a partial loss of their ability to remove FapyG:<br>OGG1 R46Q (Audebert, Radicella et al. 2000);<br>OGG1 R154H (Audebert, Radicella et al. 2000).<br>OGG1 R46L has not been functionally studied but has been reported in cancer and predicted to be pathogenic. It is annotated as a candidate disease variant for FapyG excision, based on its similarity with OGG1 R46Q.
This complex/polymer has been computationally inferred (based on PANTHER) from a complex/polymer involved in an event that has been demonstrated in another species.
This event has been computationally inferred from an event that has been demonstrated in another species.<p>The inference is based on the homology mapping from PANTHER. Briefly, reactions for which all involved PhysicalEntities (in input, output and catalyst) have a mapped orthologue/paralogue (for complexes at least 75% of components must have a mapping) are inferred to the other species. High level events are also inferred for these events to allow for easier navigation.<p><a href='/electronic_inference_compara.html' target = 'NEW'>More details and caveats of the event inference in Reactome.</a> For details on PANTHER see also: <a href='http://www.pantherdb.org/about.jsp' target='NEW'>http://www.pantherdb.org/about.jsp</a>
